A weather application using the Android (Java)platform and openweathermap API.

## Project Objective:
Develop a mobile application that allows users to input their city and displays the current weather conditions for that city.

## Requirements:
User Interface (UI): Design a clean and intuitive UI that includes an input field for city names and an area to display the weather information.

User Input: Implement an input field where users can enter their city name.

API interaction: Make a network request to the Yahoo Weather API to fetch the current weather details of the city provided by the user. 

Display Data: After receiving data from the API, display the weather information on the screen. The information should be comprehensive, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather info.
